# Car logo Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains code for a deep learning model that performs car logo detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify images of car logos into different brand categories.

### Features
- **Data Augmentation**: The training dataset undergoes data augmentation using techniques such as rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping to enhance model generalization.
- **CNN Architecture**: The model architecture consists of convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions, max-pooling layers for downsampling, and dense layers for classification. The final layer employs a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.
- **Training and Validation**: The model is trained using a portion of the dataset and validated using a separate validation set to prevent overfitting.
- **Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its accuracy on unseen data.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to visualize the training and validation accuracy across epochs, providing insights into the model's learning progress.
- **Model Saving**: The trained model is saved to a file named "model-2.h5" for future use or deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hayderabdela/car-logo-detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd car-logo-detector
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the main script:
